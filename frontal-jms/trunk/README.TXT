Simple web service project with CXF.
Take a SOAP message and transform it into a JMS Message.
Use Client.java to call the webservice.
Use >ant ivy:retrieve to get all necessary libs.

Don't forget to configure the ConnectionFactory/Queue in the JEE server.

This conf was done for Jonas but can be reuse for an other JEE server.
